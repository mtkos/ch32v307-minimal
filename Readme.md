## ch32v307-minimal

This repository is a companion to my ch32v203-minimal repository. The programs are the same, with minimal changes to make them work on the bigger board. The startup code has been changed
a little, to ensure that the vector table (if present) is always word-aligned. So -march=rv32imac_zicsr (with compressed instructions) can be used throughout. Everything has been tested on
Debian 12 (gcc 12.2) and Debian 13 (gcc 13.2).
