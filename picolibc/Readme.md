# the picolib-example program

This picolibc example prints random numbers, using the hardware random number generator, documented in chapter 29 of the manual. Using a slightly different version of this program, I created
a sequence of 1000000 random bits. This sequence was tested using the software from <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/random-bit-generation/documentation-and-software>. The sequence failed on all
tests.
